## DSA Roadmap

1. **Topic Wise Practice (Neetcode 150)**
   - Choose one topic (i.e Graphs, Trees, etc...) and review its theory  
   - Complete **all** problems for that topic from Neetcode 150
   - Simultaneously, tackle LeetCodeâ€™s daily challenge to build consistency  

2. **Mixed Practice (Neetcode 150 Shuffle)** 
   - Solve Neetcode 150 problems in a shuffled order to reinforce adaptability and recall
